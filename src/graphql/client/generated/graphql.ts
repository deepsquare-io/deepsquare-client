 * - `{{ .Step }}` and its childs, which represent the Step object using the module. Can be useful if you want the step name.
 *
 * If you want your user to pass custom steps, you can use `{{- .Step.Use.Steps | toYaml | nindent <n> }}` which is the group of steps.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * # module.yaml
 * steps:
 *   - name: my step
 *   {{- .Step.Use.Steps | toYaml | nindent 2 }}
 *   - name: my other step

 *       steps:
 *         - name: step by user

 *   - name: step by user

 * ```
 *
 * Notice that the templating follows the Go format. You can also apply [sprig](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) templating functions.
